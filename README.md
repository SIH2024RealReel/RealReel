# RealReel

**RealReel** is an advanced platform that leverages artificial intelligence to detect and display deepfake media. It uses cutting-edge techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze video frames for inconsistencies and determine if the content is deepfaked. The website also showcases AI-generated deepfake media for user exploration.
